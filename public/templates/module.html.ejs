    <div class="quote-text">We've arranged a civilization in which most crucial elements profoundly depend on science and technology. We have also arranged things so that almost no one understands science and technology. This is a prescription for disaster. We might get away with it for awhile, but sooner or later this combustible mixture of ignorance and power is going to blow up in our faces.</div>

    Geneva is a fascinating place. Especially for an expatriate. I had the luxury and opportunity to transplant myself from the United States to Geneva to work for the United Nations Refugee Agency. The wonderful part about living in Geneva as an expat is the extreme multiculturalism. People from all over the world voyage to Geneva to be part of the humanitarian and international club.
